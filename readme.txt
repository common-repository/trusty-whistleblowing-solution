== Description ==
Trusty is an instantly available, customizable and secure web-based whistleblowing solution developed by compliance experts. It is hosted on the virtual server in Germany, complies with the EU and US whistleblowing regulations and supports multiple languages.

The solution includes the front-end webpages, which are intended for potential whistleblowers. You will receive your individual link to these web pages after signing up. We suggest that you publish the link on your web-site.

On these webpages whistleblowers can submit reports, enter their inboxes and find answers to the most common questions. When submitting reports, whistleblowers are led through questions, asking them to provide the most relevant information. If you allow for anonymous reporting, whistleblowers do not need to identify themselves to submit their reports.

Once a report is submitted, an inbox is generated for every whistleblower, so they can stay in touch with you and follow their reports in a secure and confidential way. The log in credentials for the inboxes are shown on the screen so whistleblowers can write them down.

The solution also includes a powerful case management tool. There, you will be able to categorize the reports, set retention periods, write notes and follow up activities, upload files, securely communicate with whistleblowers and use numerous other features which are intuitive and easy to use.

Sign up and test it out. No upfront commitments nor credit cards required. Just a couple of minutes of your time.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why do we need a whistleblowing channel?

If your company has more than 50 employees, you are required to implement internal channels for reporting breaches to comply with the EU Whistleblower Protection Directive. It also just makes sense.
It is important to protect whistleblowers and companies. Promoting a speak-up culture and dealing with problems internally will substantially decrease costs of any reported breaches and reduce negative publicity

= How does signing up to Trusty help?

When you sign up to Trusty, you will have your internal reporting channel set up in a matter of minutes – easier and faster than setting up an email account or telephone line.

= So, what exactly do we get with Trusty?

Trusty is web-based and consists of the front-end and the case management tool. The front-end is intended for reporting persons and leads them through the simple reporting process. 
It also includes access to a reporting person’s individual inbox, which may be used for further secure communication between the company and the reporting person, if he or she would like to remain anonymous. The case management tool is intended for the persons who process the submitted reports. 
Functionalities like documenting, sorting, writing memos, attaching files, setting reminders, communicating with a reporting person are all included. It is intuitive and very simple to use.

= Where is Trusty installed and how secure is it?

Trusty is installed on the virtual server in Germany, in a high-security data centre, certified to the ISO 27001 standard and provided by Hetzner Online GmbH.
 
We use advanced encryption techniques, state of the art Firewall and submit the application to regular penetration tests for security risks.

= What languages are available?

The solution supports the following languages: Dansk, Deutsch, Eesti, English, Español, Français, Gaeilge, Hrvatski, Italiano, Latviešu, Lietuvių, Magyar, Nederlands, Norsk, Polski, Português, Română, Slovenčina, Slovenščina, Suomi, Svenska, Čeština, Ελληνικά, Български, Русский.

= What happens after I sign up?

Once you sign up you will receive the unique URL of your Trusty account (e.g. the URL for the Best Company Limited would be [https://bestcompany.trusty.report](https://bestcompany.trusty.report)) together with the link to set your password. These details will be shown directly in the WordPress and will also be sent to your email address.
On the provided web address, you will find the front-end webpages. There you will also be able to log into the case management part of the solution.

= Is there a free version available?

Yes. To support organizations with 10 or less employees, we also offer a free version of the solution with only basic functionalities. If your organizations requires such support, visit our website [https://trusty.report](https://trusty.report) and apply for the free version.

= Why is Trusty better than just opening a dedicated email address or a phone line?

Other types of reporting channels are always an option. However, also for reports received through such channels, you will need to document them, provide confirmations and feedbacks to whistleblowers in due time, ensure confidentiality and prevent access to any non-authorised staff members. 
You can spend your time setting up all these procedures and manually perform numerous tasks - or let Trusty do that for you.
